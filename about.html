							Less Is More: How Constraints Cultivate Growth
						</h5>
						<p>
							Jim Henson started working as a puppeteer in 1954,
							a fair 40-50 years before many of us even
							considered User Experience as a career. He did,
							however, take it upon himself to apply many of the
							core principles that UX Designers are falling love
							with today (or are at least using as part of our
							everyday lives). Hang out for a quick dive into the
							life of Jim Henson, with a view into his work from
							the perspective of how it pertains to what it is
							we’re doing today, that promises to even leave
							Waldorf and Statler happy.
						</p>

						<h5>About Shay</h5>
						<p>
							As a designer and front-end developer, Shay Howe
							has a passion for solving problems while building
							creative and intuitive products. Shay specializes
							in product design and interface development,
							specialties which he regularly writes and speaks
							about.
